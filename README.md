# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis

![image](movies.jpg)

Movie reviews can sometimes be a deciding factor for someone planning to go out for a movie. Wouldnâ€™t it be interesting if we could analyze movie reviews that audiences have posted on IMDb? IMDb is an acronym for Internet Movie Database, which is an online database of information related to movies.

In this repo, I performed a sentiment analysis of IMDb reviews and classified them into positive and negative classes based on their sentiment. I also used SHAP library to visualize and explain the output of the model I used.
